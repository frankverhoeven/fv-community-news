Let Users Submit News To Your Site.

== Description ==

Many blogs out there can only produce a couple articles a week while their visitors
ask for loads more. It’s sometimes a good idea to add related articles from other
blogs to your sidebar. Adding them manually takes lots of time we don’t have. With
this new Community News plugin you allow your visitors to add articles to the sidebar.
Complete with moderation panel and a settings page, you can sit back while you have
full control about the look and articles that being posted.
